Simulations of Sticky Active Particles

Builds on the work of Qi, Shen, and Nellas in Phys. Biol. 10 (2013) 026005 and J. Phys. Chem. B (2013), 117, 42, 12844â€“12849
Simulation of swimming cell motility and clumping using the ff.:
1. Stochastic (Brownian) motion
2. Lennard-Jones Potential
3. Distance-based clumping potential
4. Randomly on or off active motor to simulate swimming.
5. Variable particle-wall interactions. (sticky wall, bouncy wall, etc.)


How to run:

python motorhead-reflect.py n_cells > output.xyz
